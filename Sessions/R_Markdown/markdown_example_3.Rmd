# Introduction

We then look at the specific cases of the [International Pacific Halibut Commission](https://iphc.int/) that manages pacific halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*) and a resource sharing agreement in the Gulf of Maine for cod (*Gadus morhua*), haddock (*Melanogrammus aeglefinus*) and yellowtail flounder (*Limanda ferruginea*)[^1]. Results show that, even under a low emission scenario, most transboundary fish stocks sharing ratios, i.e., the proportion of the total catch of a fish stock taken by a given country, will change by 2050 relative to present in the direction as expected from the effects of ocean warming.

# The Fisheries

In the region, there are `r length(names(Data)[2:11])` fishing nations including `r names(Data)[2:5]`. The fishery was saved due to strict mitigation measures and the implementation of policies. Catch has fluctuated over time since the begining of the capture record `r min(Data$years, na.rm = T)` (Figure 1) with *Spain* dominating landings from the **1970's** to the late 90's when Morroco increased captures. 

```{r Historic_Plot, echo=F, eval=T, fig.align="c",fig.height=4,fig.width=7,fig.cap="Historic Landings for all nations between 1950 - 2010. Data from seaaroundus.org"}

Data %>% 
  tidyr::gather("country","catch",spain:latvia) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    aes(
      x = years,
      y = catch/10000,
      colour = country
    )
  ) +
  theme_classic()

```

The main reason why Spain reduce its fish capture was because of a stron policy implementation on the TAC based on the following equation:

\begin{center}
$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$
\end{center}

where all equations are completely made up!

While this was true for Spain, Morroco had a more relaxed policy based on the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
FR = \sum_{i = 1}^n (L_{i}*b_{i})*b*P_{i} + (L_{i}*a_{i}) *a*P_{i}
\end{equation}

They actually used Latex in the document to write that equation, just like this one: $BB_f=(M_S+D_S)*fec$, where $BB_F$ is *Baby Fish*; $M_F$ is mummy Fish and $D_F$ is Daddy Fish, and *fec* is fecundity.



# Observations

Data was obtain from, [Spain](http://www.seaaroundus.org/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw8tbHBRC6rLS024qYjtEBEiQA7wIDeUk0hWAQ_MkdhsIBczR7jaN3qC4ndTuExVUNThk0g2kaArm88P8HAQ) fisheries data from Sea Around Us.
